## Installation

### Pre-built Releases
Download the latest WGT from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Tizen/releases).

**Supported Devices:**
- Samsung Smart TVs running Tizen 4.0+
- Samsung Tizen TVs (2018 and newer models)

### Jellyseerr Setup (Optional)
To enable media discovery and requesting:

1. Install and configure Jellyseerr on your network ([jellyseerr.dev](https://jellyseerr.dev))
2. In Moonfin, go to **Settings → Jellyseerr**
3. Enter your Jellyseerr server URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:5055`)
4. Enter your Jellyseerr **API Key** (found in Jellyseerr Settings → General)
5. Test the connection, then start discovering!

> **Note:** Tizen apps use API key authentication instead of cookie-based login due to webview restrictions.

### Sideloading Instructions

The easiest way to install Moonfin on your Samsung TV is using the **Jellyfin 2 Samsung** tool:

1. Download [Jellyfin 2 Samsung](https://github.com/PatrickSt1991/Samsung-Jellyfin-Installer) tool by [@PatrickSt1991](https://github.com/PatrickSt1991)
2. Enable Developer Mode on your Samsung TV:
   - Go to **Settings → General → System Manager → Developer Mode**
   - Turn Developer Mode **ON**
   - Enter your PC's IP address
   - Restart the TV
3. Run the Jellyfin 2 Samsung tool and select the Moonfin WGT file
4. Enter your TV's IP address and install!

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server
npm run serve

# Build for production (creates WGT)
npm run build
```

The build script will create a `Moonfin.wgt` file in the `build/` folder.

### Installing to TV

Use the [Jellyfin 2 Samsung](https://github.com/PatrickSt1991/Samsung-Jellyfin-Installer) tool to install the WGT to your TV. No Tizen Studio or certificates required!

## Development

This project is built with **Enact**, a React-based application framework that works excellently on Tizen TVs.

└── styles/           # Global styles and variables
```

### Developer Notes
- Uses Enact/Sandstone for TV-optimized UI components
- Spotlight navigation for TV remote control support
- Tizen AVPlay API for hardware-accelerated video playback
- Remote keys registered via `tizen.tvinputdevice` API
- Code style follows Enact conventions
- UI changes should be tested on actual Samsung TV devices when possible

### Tizen-Specific Considerations
- **CORS**: Packaged Tizen apps (`.wgt`) bypass CORS restrictions
- **Cookies**: Cross-origin cookies don't persist in Tizen webviews - use API keys instead
- **Remote Keys**: Must be registered via `tvinputdevice.registerKey()` before use
